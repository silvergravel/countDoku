### Sudoku Solving Algorithm in Processing



__It was an uneventful evening in Berlin, so of course, solving some sudoku felt like the most appropriate way to spend my time :/ But then I ended up slipping into an obsessive ( and not very smart ) mental space that led me to spend 2 f***ing hours trying to solve an apparently ‘evil’ sudoku puzzle. It really hurt. So I thought maybe I could try and write some code that solves these frustrating puzzles and in the process, help me get over my evening of failure.__

This little beginning turned into a very fun few days, wherein, I played, I stressed, I wrote code (the kind that a developer wouldn’t take kindly to), but hey! it does the job (with minimal human input). This is one of the most pointless self initiated projects I have done in recent times, but then again, I learnt a bunch more about working with object classes, embedded loops, math, logic, debugging etc etc. I’d like to believe that occasional deep dives into code, are bound to expand my experience and skills as a interaction designer.

All the code is written in Processing and it’s all here. The code is fairly well commented, so it should explain itself. A bit messy sometimes, and far from optimized (I'm not sure I even know how to go about doing something like that) but I hope it provides amusement to you folks as well, the way it did for me :) I have also exported CountDoku as a MacOs and Windows application, which you will find in this repo as well. So you can totally run the app without looking at the code, and just give countDoku a chance to prove himself ;) If the futility of this endeavor holds you back from checking it out, know that, I have forced in some Star Wars puns as well. Maybe those would help?
